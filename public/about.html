            <h2>About Sweetpea</h2>
            <p>Many years ago, as many of us do, I discovered my love of traveling.
                I made a list of all the places I wanted to go to. I told my friends of my plans and they all were
                excited.
                Everyone wanted to go on trips together. As life would have it, one by one, each of my friends started
                falling off the list.
                And that was just for one trip.
                So I decided to try it solo. I researched like crazy. I talked to so many travel companies. My travel
                binder was
                chaotic.<br>
                That was 10 years ago.<br>
                5 years ago, I started to blog my trips. It turns out, a lot of people wanted to know how they too could
                travel solo.
                My blogs became a website, my website became a company, and now we are a fully licensed travel agency.
                If you have ever wanted to travel solo, but have no idea where to start, and/or feeling overwhelmed,
